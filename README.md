# Plugin Friendly for Skylink
Now on Github! Thanks to NetBeans, a highly functional IDE, which helps me put my maven project here.
## Brief Introduction
### Why do I work on this project
About half a year ago (that's quiet long), I was running a Minecraft server with my friend. Then he came up with the idea to develop some 
plugins which include this, __Plugin Friendly__. It was just a simple idea of that a player can have a friendly level which affects his 
permission. For example, if he's always yelling bad words, he will be muted.
### How is the development going
It's still under heavy development. The project has been restarted several times since I'm always considering what should I do and 
I was working on different computers without _Github_.
